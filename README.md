# TIR - Research Initiation Project: Datasets, Metrics, PLMs, and LLMs for Text-to-SQL

## Course Overview

### Why TIR?

The 'Travaux d'Initiation Ã  la Recherche' (TIR) is a fundamental component of the Computer Science curriculum designed to immerse students in the scientific approach and critical thinking essential in research. This module is not intended to make you a researcher but to provide a glimpse into what computer science research entails.

#### Objectives

Work: Introduction to scientific work on a specific topic.
Initiation: A stepping stone into the world of computer science
            research.
Research: Encouragement of critical thinking and continuous skill development.

#### Course Structure

Common to all CS specialities, addressing research generically. Focus on enhancing critical thinking, an essential skill in professional careers. Teamwork under the guidance of a researcher or client. Completion across three main stages: Literature Search, Full State of the Art, and Setting the Scene.

## Project Topic: Datasets, Metrics, PLMs, and LLMs for Text-to-SQL.

Our group's focus is on exploring the intersection of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and their application in Text-to-SQL contexts. We aim to investigate various datasets and metrics relevant to this field.

### Research Papers

We commence our exploration with a set of key research papers. These are housed in our docs subfolder for easy reference:

[Improving Text-to-SQL Evaluation Methodology](./docs/1806.09029.pdf)

[KaggleDBQA: Realistic Evaluation of Text-to-SQL Parsers](docs/2106.11455.pdf)

[Can LLM Already Serve as A Database Interface? A BIg Bench for Large-Scale Database Grounded Text-to-SQLs](docs/2305.03111.pdf)

### Stage Progression

#### Stage 1: Literature Search and State of the Art

Objective: To develop a comprehensive understanding of the current research landscape.
Output: Bibliography files documenting relevant literature.

#### Stage 2: Full State of the Art

Objective: To delve deeper into the literature and develop a nuanced understanding.
Output: A detailed written document outlining our findings.

#### Stage 3: Setting the Scene

Objective: To synthesize our learning and present our insights.
Output: Peer-reviewed content and a poster presentation.
